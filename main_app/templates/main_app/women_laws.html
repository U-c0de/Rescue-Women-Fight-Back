                        protect women from domestic violence. It was brought into force by the Indian government from 26 October 2006. The Act provides for the

                      of 18. Currently, India ranks 6th in the world when it comes to child marriages. Since child marriage has been
                      steeped into the Indian culture and tradition since centuries, it has been tough eliminating it. The Prohibition
                      of Child Marriage Act was made effective in 2007. This act defines child marriage as a marriage where the groom
                      or the bride are underage, that is, the bride is under 18 years of age or the boy is younger than 21 years.

                    <div class = "collapsible-body"><p>Prostitution is legal in India. A number of related activities including soliciting in a public place, 
                        kerb crawling, owning or managing a brothel, prostitution in a hotel,child prostitution, pimping and pandering are illegal.There are, 
                        however, many brothels illegally operating in Indian cities including Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai.UNAIDS estimate there were 
                        657,829 prostitutes in the country in 2016. Government organisations like MDACS (Maharashtra District AIDS Control Society) have played 
                        a very prominent role in generating awareness on HIV/AIDS through the assistance in providing free literature and organising street campaigns. 
                        There are several NGO that feed on funds for protecting STI/STDs spread to common population NACO (National AIDS Control Organisation), 
                        a government agency lead these NGOs.The law is vague on prostitution  itself.The primary law dealing with the status of sex workers is 
                        the 1956 law referred to as The Immoral Traffic (Suppression) Act (SITA). According to this law, prostitutes can practise their trade 
                        privately but cannot legally solicit customers in public.A BBC article, however, mentions that prostitution is illegal in India; the 
                        Indian law does not refer to the practice of selling one's own sexual service as "prostitution".Clients can be punished for sexual 
                        activity in proximity to a public place. Organised prostitution (brothels, prostitution rings, pimping, etc.) is illegal. As long as it 
                        is done individually and voluntarily, a woman (male prostitution is not recognised in any law in India) can use her body in exchange for 
                        material benefit. In particular, the law forbids a sex worker to carry on her profession within 200 yards of a public place. Unlike as is 
                        the case with other professions, sex workers are not protected under normal labour laws, but they possess the right to rescue and 
                        rehabilitation if they desire, and they possess all the rights of other citizens.Over the years, India has seen a growing mandate to 
                        legalise prostitution, to avoid exploitation of sex workers and their children by middlemen and in the wake of a growing HIV/AIDS menace.

                      family by the groom and his family. The system has taken strong roots because women after marriage move in with their spouse and in-laws. 
                      Also, over the centuries, the lack for economic independence of women and the taboo towards divorce has resulted in bride burning. 
                      When demands for dowry even after marriage are not met by the girl&#39s families, many women are tortured, beaten and even burnt. It is one
                      of the major challenges that our society is grappling with. Women openly complaining about it has helped to spread the word and encourage
